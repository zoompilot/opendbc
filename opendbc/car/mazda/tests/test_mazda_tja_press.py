openpilot never presses the TJA button. On the car's side it toggles MADS and arms MRCC; on the
camera's side it switches the car's own lane-keep setting off (CAM_SETTINGS), after which the
EPS applies none of our request (route 7c735af5fce56485/00000105, 2026-09-12).

The MRCC undo (zoompilot/opendbc#17): on a declared TJA car the physical press also arms MRCC in
the body. When MRCC was off before the press, the controller answers with the wheel's own MRCC
master press on bus 0 until raw PEDALS confirms the arm is gone; a pre-armed MRCC is the driver's
and is left alone.
