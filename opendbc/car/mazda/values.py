  # RESUME_UNLATCHING at the release comes in two families (33-pulse census over the stock
  # corpus, tools/mazda_long release grammar scan, 2026-08-27):
  #   - a body-latched hold pulses 6-11 wire frames (0.12-0.20 s, mode 9) while the command
  #     ramps off the relaxed -0.001; nothing stock ever pulsed longer than 0.20 s
  #   - a never-latched stop only blips 1-6 wire frames (mostly 2-3), starting ~3 wire frames
  #     AFTER the stop bits drop, once the command has relax-jumped into its release band
  # Treating every release as a long latched-style pulse held the unlatch bit over hold-grade
  # braking, a tuple stock never emits, and the camera latched SCBS 90 ms in
  # (route 00000053 t+714.8, second CX-5, with a real departing lead advertised)
  RESUME_UNLATCH_LATCHED_T = 0.18  # s, 9 wire frames, the latched-family mode
  # The pulse is the release protocol: the body answers nothing else. Deferring it behind
  # silence (route 0000011d, 0.3 s) and behind a +0.15 m/s2 nudge (route 0000012c, 2.0 s,
  # three latched stops) both left GEAR.BRAKE_HOLD untouched for the whole window, and the
  # body then dropped it within 2-3 wire frames of the fallback pulse every time. So a
  # latched release pulses immediately -- waiting only added dead time to every resume.
  # Stock's never-latched blip stays dropped: nothing is latched there, so it unlatches
  # nothing. The SCBS latch that used to key on the pulse (10 of 10 with a healthy camera,
  # across builds up to a byte-level stock twin) is addressed on the radar side instead:
  # every one of those pulses went out while the advertised lead track carried the
  # empty-slot status signature (see LEAD_TRACK_TEMPLATE in mazdacan.py).

  CANCEL_CONTEXT_T = 0.5       # a wheel CANCEL keeps availability drops landing this long after release

  # The plan flapping across zero at a held standstill (a lead inches forward and stops) used
  # to fire a fresh RESUME_UNLATCHING pulse per flap and re-assert the stop bits mid-pulse, a
  # combination stock never emits (stock pulses exactly once per release, stop bits already
  # dropped). The plan must ask to move this long before the hold releases; stock's releases
  # lag the lead's departure by at least this much (all 23 latched releases show the lead
  # already opening at >= +0.31 m/s at the pulse, ~0.2 s into a typical drive-off).

  # advertised lead only follows a state that has held steady, the way Hyundai debounces its
  # lead bit for 50 frames
  LEAD_DEBOUNCE_T = 0.5

  # Stock relaxes its standstill command the instant the body ECU takes the hold over, not on any
  # schedule: across 13 stock holds >= 4.5 s the relax and GEAR.BRAKE_HOLD agreed to within
  # +-0.02 s in all 9 where both were visible, and the latch itself landed anywhere from 0.01 s

  # The release command itself follows stock's shape, not a slew off the hold value. At a
  # never-latched release stock relax-jumps the command in ONE frame from the hold value into
  # a -0.27..-0.18 start (pulse-frame commands span -0.269..-0.111 across the whole corpus)
  # and then ramps ~+25 raw per 50 Hz frame straight through the drive-off; a latched release
  # ramps at the same rate off the relaxed -0.001. Slewing up from -1.024 instead kept
  # hold-grade braking on the wire beneath the release pulse (route 00000053 t+714.8), and
  # pre-ramping toward the plan crossed zero inside it (route 00000100 t+353) -- the band
  # between those two edges is what the camera accepts.
  ACCEL_RELEASE_BAND = -0.26  # m/s2, the one-frame relax target at a never-latched release
  ACCEL_RELEASE_RAMP = 1.25   # m/s3, stock's release ramp (+25 raw per 50 Hz frame)

  # The ramp above hands the command back the moment it catches the plan, which assumes the
  # plan's own value is enough to get the car rolling. It is not always. On the EPS-swapped
  # CX-9 the plan parked at +0.42..+0.47 behind a lead 2.5 m ahead and the car sat dead still
  # for the whole 1.5 s the command was held there, until the driver used the pedal (route
  # 00000009--ad9e22f986 t+452.9); the CX-5 releases in the corpus only ever broke away once
  # the command had climbed past +1.0 (route_118 t+581.6: the only clean corpus breakaway,
  # last still frame at +1.17, first rolling frame at +1.07). It was not the grade: the
  # accelerometer puts that stop at +0.41 deg nose-up, 0.07 m/s2 of gravity, effectively flat
  # (the three stops the driver gassed out of were on up to +2.4 deg). So the ramp keeps
  # climbing past the plan for as long as the car is still stopped. LongControl cannot do this
  # itself: Mazda runs the default ki of 0, so its pid state emits the plan's a_target verbatim
  # with no integrator to wind up against a car that is not moving.
  #
  # The ceiling is stock's own. Over all 31 stock stop->go episodes in the corpus (the whole
  # population -- stock MRCC is rarely still engaged at a standstill), the command on the last
  # still frame, i.e. what the car actually broke away at:
  #   body-latched  (n=21): min +0.405  p25 +0.810  median +0.958  max +1.425
  #   never-latched (n=10): min -0.001  p25 +0.213  median +0.665  max +1.416
  # and stock then carries on to a median +1.38 / max +1.94 through the drive-off. So pulling
  # away from a stop is a firm request on this car, not a creep: a ceiling below ~+1.0 sits
  # under stock's own median and would leave the CX-9 exactly where it was. +1.45 clears every
  # breakaway stock has ever needed here, so we never give up earlier than stock would.
  #
  # The override still only climbs until the car moves, and stock's own median says most stops
  # break away far below this -- one never-latched stock release moved at -0.001, pure creep.
  # The ~0.3 s actuator dead time carries the command ~0.38 past the value that actually broke
  # the car free before standstill clears, which is why the cap is what bounds the worst case.
  #
  # What the corpus does NOT settle is the CX-9 itself: the qlog carries no CAN, so
  # GEAR.BRAKE_HOLD and the stop bits are unobservable there. A body brake latch invisible to
  # us is still on the table, and would not be cured by asking harder. An rlog would settle it.
  ACCEL_BREAKAWAY_MAX = 1.45  # m/s2, ceiling for the still-stopped release ramp
  # ...and it gives up after this long, so a car held by something we cannot see -- a kerb, a
  # steep grade, a foot on the brake -- settles back onto the plan instead of being leaned on
  # indefinitely.
  ACCEL_BREAKAWAY_T = 3.0  # s

  # Command slew limits, m/s3, on the plan-following command only. Asymmetric on purpose: the
  # windup limit is what keeps the command from dumping the brake in one frame (the driver-felt
  # problem), while a tight winddown limit would delay real braking for no measured benefit.
  # 4.0 sits above the p99 of the plan's own up-slew on the reporter's route (p99 +3.2, p99.9
