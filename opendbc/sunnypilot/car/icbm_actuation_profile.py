Per-car actuation profile for Intelligent Cruise Button Management (ICBM).

On button-actuated (non-pcmCruiseSpeed) cars the stock ECU integrates the cruise buttons,
and every ECU does it differently: how fast discrete presses register and whether the ACC
delays deceleration while the set speed is still changing. The servo that plans button
moves reads these characteristics from here, and the stock ACC plant behind them: how hard
it brakes for a dash gap, which the curve and limit planners budget for
(smart_cruise_control/limits.py).

Cars without a measured profile get DEFAULT_PROFILE: discrete taps only, no hold;
the long-standing ICBM behavior. A brand only changes behavior by adding a measured entry.
Measurements behind the Mazda entry: docs/zoompilot/icbm.md.
